This tool is based on [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools), different actions are implemented in therms of `lanes`.

### Setup

In order to access the gitlab instances, you'll need to provide their endpoint and an API access-token.

For fastlane to be able to access those, you will need have to provide some information in the `.env` file. 
This repo already contains a file named `env` at its root level. Enter the gitlab endpoints and API access-tokens there, remove the comments and change the filename to `.env`.
